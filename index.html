			<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>Greetings! I am Saul, an aspiring programmer currently in my <b>first year</b> of my degree in <b>Games Programming at Staffordshire University</b>.</p>
				<p>I am an avid fan of <b>Turn Based Strategy, MMOs and MOBAs</b>, but my interests spill into all kinds of games. Alongside my interest in video games I also greatly enjoy tabletop games including D&D and board games.</p>
				<p>When I'm not playing games, I can often be found programming them! I am currently involved in learning <b>C++</b> and have been dabbling in <b>C#</b> using the <b>Unity Engine</b>.</p>
				<p>Follow me on Twitter for updates on things I'm working on. I use LinkedIn so if you would like to connect please add me on there. I also use GitHub as a repoistory for my projects, you can check out my profile below. Or if you would like to get in touch with me more directly, please e-mail me at: <b>s.appleford1@gmail.com</b>.</p>

			<h1>Portfolio</h1>
				<p>My portfolio may be in its early days but it is ever expanding. Alongside my coursework I am undertaking <b>personal projects</b> as well as <b>game jams</b> as part of a larger team. Stay tuned for updates!</p>
				
			<h4>Astrorum Resurgemus - Week 1 Game Jam</h4>
				<p>The first week of our course saw us complete a game jam alongside fellow students. I met Aled, Jack and Haz which saw the formation of our team: <b>Bring on The Wall!</b></p>
				<p>We set out to create our game in just under a week. We wanted to create a relatively simple space shooter akin to classics such as <b>Space Invaders</b> and <b>Galaga</b>.</p>
				<div class = "row">
				<img class = "col s6 offset-s3" src="assets/game1.png" max-width="100%" height="auto"/>
				</div>
				<blockquote>
				<p>Our game was made using <b>C#</b> in the <b>Unity Engine</b>.</p>
				<p>The sound effects were a particularly fun contribution to the game. I worked closely with the lads to ensure the final build ran correctly. This was the first game any of us had ever made. We were so chuffed when it was done, <b>we couldn't stop playing it!</b></p>

			<h1>Projects</h1>
				<p>I am currently undertaking a few personal projects in an effort to <b>further my programming skills</b> as well as explore some of my own </b>game ideas</b>.</p>
				<p>I often post updates about my projects and undertakings on my <a href="https://twitter.com/saul_appleford" target="_blank">Twitter Account</a> so please consider following me there!</p>
				
			<h4>Astrorum Resurgemus - Star Rising</h4>
				<p>Taking direct inspiration from our week 1 game jam, I am making efforts to pursue Astrorum Resurgemus further! We had a lot more ideas than we had time to implement them, so I figured it would be a good place to start.</p>
				<p>Whilst the retro-gameplay feel served us well for a first game, a more modern <b>bullet-hell</b> experience seemed an appropriate direction for the newly souped-up space shooter. The retro art style gets to stick around though, pixels all the way.</p>

				<blockquote>
				<p>Star Rising is currently being made using <b>C#</b> in the <b>Unity Engine</b>, developing on the skills learned in the week 1 game jam.</p>
				<p>Whilst I'm currently flying solo on Star Rising, I've reached out to the gang to continue the project someday. Perhaps when deadlines are out of the way!</p>
				</blockquote>
				
			<h4>Voidbeak</h4>
				<p>Voidbeak is a bit of an odd one. I have always enjoyed <b>2D Platformers</b> and <b>Metroidvania</b> games. I was greatly inspired by <b>Team Cherry's Hollow Knight</b> during my earliest delve into development.</p>
				<p>Whilst I would not consider myself an artist, I have taken up the digital brush to try and bring a bit of life to my <b>2D Platformer</b> in-the-works so as to capture a fraction of what made Hollow Knight so striking.</p>
				<p>I expect this project to be a strain on my creative muscles as much as it will test my programming resolve. As of now I have Voidbeak's character design, early sprite and basic animtions along with movement sorted. This one is pretty close to my heart, so it's definitely one to watch!</p>

			<h1>Beyond Programming...</h1>
				<p>Programming is my passion... but I do other things too! I am a huge lover of <b>music</b> and <b>sound</b>. I am a self-taught pianist and it was once my aspiration to become a <b>Soundtrack Composer</b> for video games!</p>
				<p>Whilst this has taken a backseat in favour of a more programming-oriented career, it is still a hobby that I nurture every day. I compose mostly for fun and take inspiration from games I enjoy such as <b>World of Warcraft</b>. Here's a themesong I made for a friend's character.</p>
				<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/664269461&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe>
				<p>Alongside music I have a great interest in writing and the creation of games from a more design-oriented perspective. My writing mostly involves the creation of original homebrew content for use in Dungeons and Dragons which I intend to someday publish.</p>
				<p>I will always maintain a heavy focus on Programming, but I am also greatly interested in just about <b>EVERY</b> element that goes into a game.</p>
				<p>That's a bit about me. If anything you've read here has piqued your curiosity I would really appreciate a follow over on Twitter or to connect on LinkedIn. I'm always eager to meet and speak to new people so even if you just fancy a chat, it would be great to hear from you!</p>
